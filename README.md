// Our course was made up of a series of walls that the robot would need to traverse around. There were also 2 walls that could be rotated and moved when pushed against. The robot will need a good amount of power to push these walls so that it can pass through. As for the many normal walls, the robot will need to travel through them by hitting the sides as little as possible and finding the right path. For running the python script you need to turn the robot on, connect the brain to the code, and then let it connect and run. The code consisted of driving forward, followed by a turn and driving forward again. The building and designing of the obstacle course was very easy. We were able to succesfully build the course similar to our design and the overall process was not too hard. The only problems we had were figuring out how to make the rotating walls without them getting stuck, and also the code. We really struggled on the code as we could not connect the robot to my computer and we were new to code. We eventually figured it out with the help of the teachers and all went well.
